    'beebmx.kirby-pay.styles' => [
        'button' => 'bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-sm appearance-none px-3 py-2 w-full',

    ]
];
```

## Webhooks

*Kirby Pay* has many webhooks to hear for every service, for connect it, you need to know which URL you need to set, and for that reason is the `env` option.
Set the `env` to `test` or `local` to enable the development option in the panel:

````php
return [
    'beebmx.kirby-pay.env' => 'local'
];
````

Now you can enter in the development mode and view the Webhook URL.

## Hooks

In the most of the cases you need to notify to the user if the payment was sucessfuly done, and for that reason are hooks.
All the time than you require to implement any hook, you will receive a payment object.
Here is an example to use it with `stripe`:

```php
return [
    'hooks' => [
        'beebmx.kirby-pay.payment_intent.succeeded' => function ($payment) {
            //Send your email
        },
    ]
];
```

As you can see, it's like any webhook of the service but with the prefix of the package `beebmx.kirby-pay.` is the way to catch all the hooks.
You can check the list of the webhooks of the services:

- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types)
- [Conekta](https://developers.conekta.com/api#events)

## Development

When you are in developing your shopping cart or any implementation, sometimes you don't need to create a real payment process, for that reason is the `sandbox` service, to simulate any payment but everithing is local.

```php
return [
    'beebmx.kirby-pay.service' => 'sandbox'
];
```

In the `sandbox` service you can try one webhook. Just sent a `POST` request to your webhook URL and send:

```json
{
  "type": "test.webhook"
}
```

You will receive a response like:

```json
{
    "message": "Webhook Received"
}
```

And a hook will be trigger too:

```php
return [
    'hooks' => [
        'beebmx.kirby-pay.test.webhook' => function ($payment) {
            //Test your code
        },
    ],
];
```

### Development logs

When you are working with webhooks, sometimes you need to check the response of the webhook or maybe you just want to store all the events in your server.
To enable that option just:

```php
return [
    'beebmx.kirby-pay.logs' => true,
];
```
